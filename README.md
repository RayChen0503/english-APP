# English+

English+ is an Android prototype for a rural English learning support platform. The product direction is simple: students should not meet English practice as pressure first. The app starts from mood, time, and a small next action, then routes harder emotional or learning breakpoints to AI support, teachers, or volunteers.

## Current Version

- Version name: `0.7.0`
- Version code: `7`
- Android application id: `tw.edu.citizenaction.soracompanion`
- Minimum SDK: `26`
- Target SDK: `35`
- Current status: classroom demo / internal testing prototype

## What Is Working Now

- Student and teacher/volunteer tracks.
- Today-first home screen with low-pressure next actions.
- Mood and time check-in.
- Short English practice tasks.
- Question answering, feedback, and repair hints.
- Help request flow for emotional or learning breakpoints.
- AI support lab with local fallback and proxy-ready architecture.
- Teacher/volunteer handoff board and action queue.
- Student roster and student detail screens.
- SQLite persistence for app state, learning events, accounts, collaboration notes, offline sync items, and question bank items.
- Question bank center with level, unit, skill, and source metadata.
- Offline task packs and sync center.
- Cloud backend client scaffolding for future sync and collaboration endpoints.
- Weekly report and shareable demo report text.
- Product principles, OPPM checks, and in-app design system.
- JVM unit tests for repository data and core model invariants.

## Prototype Limits

This is not a production release yet. The following areas still need formal implementation before public launch:

- Firebase Auth / Google sign-in or a school account system.
- Real cloud database and authorization rules.
- Real-time multi-device collaboration.
- Production AI proxy with server-side OpenAI key storage.
- Complete licensed question bank and content management workflow.
- PDF / Word report export and teacher dashboard.
- Privacy policy, data safety form, and student data governance.
- Full Android UI tests, physical-device testing, and multi-screen QA.

## Build And Test

Open `D:\SoraCompanion` in Android Studio, wait for Gradle sync, then run the `app` configuration on an Android device or emulator.

Command-line verification:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME='C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr'
$env:PATH="$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
.\gradlew.bat :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebug --console=plain
```

Debug APK output:

```

## Release Preparation Notes

The project now has a release build type and a placeholder `proguard-rules.pro`, but it is not signed for store upload yet. A Google Play release will still require:

- Release keystore.
- Signed Android App Bundle (`.aab`).
- Play App Signing.
- Store listing assets.
- Privacy policy URL.
- Data Safety answers.
- Closed/internal testing.
